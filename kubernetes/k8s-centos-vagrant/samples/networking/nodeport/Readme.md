# NodePort
While TargetPort and ClusterIP make it available to inside the cluster, the NodePort exposes the service on each Nodeâ€™s IP via the defined static port. No matter which Node within the cluster is accessed, the service will be reachable based on the port number defined.

```
$ kubectl apply -f nodeport.yaml
service "webapp1-nodeport-svc" created
deployment "webapp1-nodeport-deployment" created
```

When viewing the service definition, notice the additional type and NodePort property defined 
```
$ cat nodeport.yaml

$ kubectl get svc
$ kubectl describe svc/webapp1-nodeport-svc
```

The service can now be reached via the Node's IP address on the NodePort defined.

```
$ curl 172.17.0.73:30080
```
